This is the web based drum sequencer created for [AutomaBeat](/post/automabeat) - my Raspberry Pi powered mechanical drum machine. It works
across devices (tablets, mobile phones, desktops etc), using web sockets to trigger the GPIO pins through a Python server.
A preview of the sequencer can be seen at [pibeat.banjowise.com](http://pibeat.banjowise.com).

I have open sourced the code at [GitHub](https://github.com/mnkii/pibeat), and an Instructable on how to create
your own drum machine is [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Raspberry-Pi-Powered-Junk-Drum-Machine/).
