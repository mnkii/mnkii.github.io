A Raspberry Pi powered mechanical drum machine.

The electronics consist of 8 12v solenoids connected to a Raspberry Pi via a relay. It can be controlled by the
web based drum sequencer which I have called [PiBeat](/post/pibeat), or drum patterns can be scripted.

The drums are mostly made from things found around the house. The hammers to hit the can and beer bottle are taken from
a chopped up piano found in a skip.

An instructable how to create your own is [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Raspberry-Pi-Powered-Junk-Drum-Machine/), a script to program patterns is [here](https://gist.github.com/mnkii/8ab0d749c26379936c14e96cfaa92f7e), and
the script for the demo sequence is [here](https://gist.github.com/mnkii/917205e9925a661548759a326e7a776d).
