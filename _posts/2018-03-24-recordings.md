A collection of badly recorded traditional tunes, rough ideas, experiments and noodlings.

### Mazomenos / Sally In The Garden

A Greek tune I heard through Turkish Saz playing, paired with the old time classic. Also my first attempt at using
Garageband.

### Mississippi Sawyer

Laid back version of the old time favourite.

### March

Chillouty tune evolved from holding down too many notes on the melodeon.

### Second Chance

A short little riff I've been playing about with in a slightly odd time signature.

### Wine and Gin

A very catchy little tune.
