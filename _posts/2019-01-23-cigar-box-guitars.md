    text: Notching the neck is nice and easy with the table saw, the remainder flies out with a hammer and chisel. The angle of the neck is just a guess for now, I'll cut it more precisely when the strings are on.

I am certainly no luthier, but after [a few failed attempts](/img/cigar-box-guitar-build/failed-attempts.jpg), a lot of
trial and error and a lot of fun, I now have a couple of very playable Cigar Box Guitars.

![image](/assets/images/cigar-box-guitar-build/2-guitars.jpg)

There are so many resources out there to get up and running,
[Glenn Watt's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC27KwzlBGeTQInXHZ9cRzQw) youtube channel is really inspirational.

Here is how I built #2 (or #5 counting the failures):

The main ingredients:

* A cigar box
* 33 x 200mm oak cut to about 800mm for the neck
* 33 x 200mm oak cut to 400mm for the heel
* 33 x 15mm oak cut to around 200mm oak for the headstock
* 6mm x 500m mahogony for the fretboard cut a little bit wider than the neck.
